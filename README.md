# Heart-Attack-risk
A machine learning project aimed at predicting the risk of heart attack using various medical and lifestyle factors. This repository contains datasets, data preprocessing scripts, and models trained to assess heart attack risk. The goal is to assist in early detection and risk assessment of heart disease.

Description of dataset

Patient ID: A unique identifier for each patient. Used to track individual patient data.

Age: The age of the patient, an important factor in assessing heart disease risk.

Sex: The gender of the patient, typically "male" or "female," which can influence heart disease risk.

Cholesterol: The cholesterol level of the patient. High cholesterol is a significant risk factor for heart disease.

Blood Pressure: The blood pressure reading of the patient, categorized into different ranges (e.g., normal, high, low).

Heart Rate: The resting heart rate of the patient, indicating cardiovascular health.

Diabetes: Indicates whether the patient has diabetes (Yes = 1, No = 0). Diabetes is a risk factor for heart disease.

Family History: Indicates whether the patient has a family history of heart disease (Yes = 1, No = 0).

Smoking: Indicates whether the patient smokes (Yes = 1, No = 0). Smoking increases the risk of heart disease.

Obesity: Indicates whether the patient is obese (Yes = 1, No = 0). Obesity is a major risk factor for heart disease.

Alcohol Consumption: Indicates whether the patient consumes alcohol (Yes = 1, No = 0). Excessive alcohol can lead to heart disease.

Exercise Hours Per Week: The number of hours the patient exercises per week. Regular exercise improves heart health.

Diet: The patientâ€™s diet, which can influence the risk of heart disease (e.g., healthy, unhealthy).

Previous Heart Problems: Indicates whether the patient has had previous heart problems (Yes = 1, No = 0). Prior heart issues increase the risk of future problems.

Medication Use: Indicates whether the patient uses medication (Yes = 1, No = 0). Medications help control risk factors for heart disease.

Stress Level: The stress level of the patient, likely on a scale (e.g., 0 = low, 1 = medium, 2 = high). High stress can contribute to heart disease.

Sedentary Hours Per Day: The number of hours the patient is sedentary each day. A sedentary lifestyle is associated with higher heart disease risk.

Income: The income level of the patient. Income can influence access to healthcare and lifestyle factors.

BMI (Body Mass Index): A measure of body fat based on height and weight. BMI is used to assess whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

Triglycerides: The level of triglycerides in the patient's blood. High triglycerides are a risk factor for heart disease.

Physical Activity Days Per Week: The number of days per week the patient engages in physical activity. Regular physical activity lowers heart disease risk.

Sleep Hours Per Day: The number of hours the patient sleeps each day. Sleep quality and quantity are linked to heart health.

Country: The country where the patient resides. Regional healthcare systems and lifestyle factors can impact heart disease risk.

Continent: The continent where the patient is located. This can be used to analyze patterns in heart disease risk across different regions.

Hemisphere: The hemisphere (e.g., Northern or Southern) where the patient lives. Environmental and health trends can vary by hemisphere.

Heart Attack Risk: The target variable indicating the patient's risk of having a heart attack. This could be a binary outcome (high risk or low risk) or a continuous score.
